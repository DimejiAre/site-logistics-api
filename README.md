## About

This is the backend API for managing logistics operations related to sites, trucks, and tickets. The project uses Node.js, PostgreSQL, and follows modern backend development practices with NestJS.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: It is highly recommended to use Node v22. You can find installation instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- **PostgreSQL**: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your machine. Installation details are available [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DimejiAre/site-logistics-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Update `.env.development` and `.env.local` with your PostgreSQL username and password.
